zee commands

General low-level commands:
T – reset motor controller (wait at least 0.1 s after a reset before sending any other commands)
C – clear all pending commands 
P – pause the command in progress 
U – when paused, resume all pending commands 
W – wait for an interrupt after all pending commands have completed 
E – enable both motors
D – disable both motors

High-level commands that use the current settings defined in /var/smith/config/settings:
I – initialize the controller with all necessary parameters and enable both axes
H – go home (both Z & rotation axes, followed by RHomingAngleMilliDegrees rotation) & await interrupt
G – go to print start/calibration position & await interrupt
F – first layer separation & await interrupt
B – burn-in layer separation & await interrupt
M – model layer separation & await interrupt
f – first layer approach & await interrupt
b – burn-in layer approach & await interrupt
m – model layer approach & await interrupt
S – reload/refresh settings from settings file

In the following commands, all values are integers, optionally signed.

Axis parameter commands:
z<parameter><value> –  set Z-axis parameter to given value
r<parameter><value> – set rotation axis parameter to given value
possible parameters:
n – step angle in millidegrees per step
u – number of units of travel (microns or millidegrees) for each motor revolution
t – microstepping mode, 1 = full step,  2 = half step, ..., 6 = 1/32 step
s – target speed for following moves (microns/s or RPM)
j – maximum jerk for following moves (idiots/cubic minute), defines the acceleration profile 

Axis action commands:
Z<action><value> - perform Z-axis action with given value 
R<action><value> - perform rotation axis action with given value
posible actions:
V – move given number of units (positive values are upward or clockwise)
L – move to limit switch (or given number of units if limit switch isn't tripped first)
 
So for example, if you wanted to initialize and home the system using the current settings, you could just issue these two high-level commands:
I
H

But you could also do the same thing by issuing the following low-level commands (where the comments following // would not be entered):
T 		// reset
		// wait 0.1 s to avoid erasing the following commands as part of the reset
zn1800		// set Z step angle to 1.8 degrees
zu2000		// set Z units to 2 mm/rotation
zt4		// set Z microsteps to 1/8
rn1800		// set rotation step angle to 1.8 degrees
ru180000	// set rotation units to 180 degrees/rotation (2:1 gear ratio)
rt4		// set rotation microsteps to 1/8
E		// enable motors
	// the above commands do the same thing as 'I' (with the default settings), and the ones below do the same thing as 'H'
rj3000000	// set max jerk for rotation
rs20		// set target rotation speed to 100 RPM
RL360000	// rotate to limit switch, but no more than 360 degrees
RV-60000	// rotate 60 degrees CCW
zj1000000	// set max jerk for Z movement
zs5000		// set target Z speed to 8mm/s
ZL330000	// move up to limit switch, but no more than 330mm
W		// request and await an interrupt when all the above commands are completed
